![Rick Roll in xterms]()

## How to Roll

To start rick rollin' immediately:

    curl https://raw.github.com/keroserene/rickrollrc/master/astley.sh | bash


## Deets

For most effectiveness, make sure you're on a 256-color terminal.
(After all, this is a colorful hobby.)
For the basic experience:

    ./astley.sh

During Rick's performance, if you wish to prevent rude interruptions and 
signals from things like Ctrl-C, etc. (and replace them with lyrics).

    ./astley.sh evil

If you *really* will Never Give You Up, 
then you should append to $USER's bashrc. (highly recommended)

    ./astley.sh inject

To go for the gold:

    ./astley.sh inject evil

Finally, to spread the love,
chmod 777 on lulz and display prominently in $HOME.

    ./lulz

Which does *everything*. :)

## Misc.

If you've astley-overdosed:

    ./astley.sh stop

Enjoy! Feel free to fork, rice-out, pull-request, etc.
