# rickrollrc

Bash script which [Rick Rolls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling) your
terminal by playing a Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up music video inside
your 256-color terminal with audio (if available).

## How to Roll
To start rick rollin' immediately:

    curl https://raw.github.com/keroserene/rickrollrc/master/roll.sh | bash

Here is the clandestine command you can give to your friends :)

    curl -L http://bit.ly/10hA8iC | bash

![rickroll in mac](http://i.imgur.com/yDLaZna.png)

This has been tested on debian and mac (so far).

This does not mean it's a good idea to make a habit of:
"curl $(random_script_from_the_internets) | bash"

Nevertheless, for the enhanced experience, I highly recommend the following:

    echo "curl https://raw.github.com/keroserene/rickrollrc/master/roll.sh | bash" >> ~/.bashrc
