# rickrollrc - Rick Roll from the terminal.

These scripts Rick Roll your terminal, with the option to enable
indefinite "Never Gonna Give You Up" encores for those who seek
vigorous, 80s musicvideo appreciation sessions.

![Rick Roll in xterms]()

## How to Roll

To get started, just do:

    wget https://raw.github.com/keroserene/rickrollrc/master/lulz
    ./lulz

## Details & Dependencies

For most effective Roll'n, use a 256-color terminal.
(After all, Rick Rolling is a colorful hobby.)

For the basic interactive experience:

    ./astley.sh

For the enhanced-lulz experience (Which is handy because it injects rickrollrc 
into bashrc):

    ./lulz
 
During the performance, if you'd like to intercept rude interruptions such as SIGINT,
SIGTERM, etc. and replace them with lyrics, do the following:

    ./astley.sh evil


Finally, to go for the gold:

    ./astley.sh inject evil

This is what ./lulz automatically does + and more. :)

## Misc.

If you've astley-overdosed, run:

    ./astley.sh stop


Enjoy! Feel free to fork, rice-out, pull-request, etc.

Kudos to @jart for lovely hiptext shenanigans ;)
